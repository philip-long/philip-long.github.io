<p>
         I am team lead and PI of the RoboMate project which is a 18-month National Challenge Fund project funded by SFI.  The aim of the project is to create a software and control architecture that enables non-expert users to efficiently program and re-configure collaborative robots in Irish manufacturing. In doing so we aim to amplify the abilities of the workers and improve ergonomics.

  The proposed solution is an accessible, easily deployed collaborative robotic system which functions as a smart tool, able to be programmed to execute repetitive tasks by operators regardless of background, age, abilities or disabilities. The system would allow untrained workers with previous task experience to teach and direct collaborative robots during execution of physical operations. This worker acts as a supervisor to the robot. The resulting team would combine the intelligence and experience of human workers with the robot's ability to carry out repetitive tasks accurately enabling flexible at-volume manufacturing without the reliance on low-cost labour.  </i>
