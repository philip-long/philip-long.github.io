    To de-mystify the safety requirements around HRC, IMR chose to construct, from the bottom up, a fully collaborative demonstrator where human and robot would work together to assemble a medical device. In doing so, IMR would highlight the pain points associated with this process and earn valuable experience which can then be passed on to partner organisations.
  Collaborative robots (Cobots) and humans can work together to complete a complex assembly task, improving productivity and reducing ergonomic strain.
