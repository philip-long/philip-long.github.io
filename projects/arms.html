     ARMS was an ANR ARPEGE project accepted in 2010 for 4 years (funded by the French National Agency of Research). The main goal of the project was to demonstrate the capabilities of a multi-arms system in muscle separation tasks. I was responsable for the modeling and control of the multi-arm system. The main contributions of this work were: multi-robot control of deformable bodies and robotic cutting using force/vision controllers.

    In this video, a global controller is simulated for the meat cutting task. The object is modeled using finite elements and simulated in MSC ADAMS.

    In this video, an example closed chain manipulation of a deformable object is demonstrated. The object is modeled using finite elements and simulated in MSC ADAMS.

    In this video, the formalism derived for cooperative manipulators is applied  to a parallel Gough Stewart manipulator.  At high accelerations, the platform may deform. A closed form solution for the inverse dynamic model is derived and  validated in MSC ADAMS. This solution allows us to calculate the joint torque from the Cartesian and generalized deformable variables' accelerations.

    In this video, the robotic separation of a soft foam like material is shown. The deformable trajectory is tracked by a camera, while a force controller is used to ensure global deformation (i.e. ripping of the material) is avoided. The force correction is applied in the Cartesian space. A second robot maintains the object and reduced cutting friction by opening up the cutting valley

    <i> 
        In this video, the robotic separation of a soft foam like material is shown. In this case, the control law is formulated entirely in the image space of the camera, leading to a robust controller. In addition to this, by using image moments, 6-DOF can be controlled. The force correction is applied directly in the image space.
