         MAAS is a 2-year project funded by Smart Eureka and supported by Enterprise Ireland (EI) and the Centre for the Development of Industrial Technology (CDTI), with Airbus, TEG, Robotnik and IMR.  The goal was to Develop of an automatic approach to Measurement Aided Assembly of large-scale Structures.

  <p>
The adaptive robotics team aims to advance robot capabilities as a component of a wider industry 4.0 shift. With this in mind, we are developing a pilot flexible intralogistics line that forms part of a paradigm shift from linear assembly lines to “automated cells“ served by mobile robots. In IMR our pilot demonstration comprises 4 work-stations (either automated or manually operator) that complete an assembly task.

        <h2> Safe Human Robot Collaboration</h2>  
<br>

<br>
    
  <p>
Classical industrial robots can operate at high speeds and with excellent precision but require stringent security measures and significant factory floor footprint. An alternative paradigm is human robot collaboration where the robot can carry out the mundane or dangerous portion of the task while the human carries out the complex part. While this presents an attractive model, the lack of clarity about safety requirements is hindering uptake in the Irish manufacturing eco-system. </p>

    This is a DOE (Department of Energy) funded project exploring the possibility of using humanoid robots for decommissioning and decontamination work. Humanoid robots are desirable in this scenario for several reasons: the environments are designed for humans (doors, stairs, human tools etc.), exteremely harzardous for operators, system is a general solution applicable to a range of different tasks.

<p>
    The project FAST is a IRT project in partnership with Renault and Europe Technologies. I was responsable for the human/robot coexistence work package. The objective was to allow the installation of robotic systems without fences or physical security devices. In order to do this, we designed a series of security modes or states for the robot.

 <h2> ARMS Project</h2>

     <p>
     ARMS was an ANR ARPEGE project accepted in 2010 for 4 years (funded by the French National Agency of Research). The main goal of the project was to demonstrate the capabilities of a multi-arms system in muscle separation tasks. I was responsable for the modeling and control of the multi-arm system. The main contributions of this work were: multi-robot control of deformable bodies and robotic cutting using force/vision controllers.

    <p>
        One of the principal research areas of the robotics team at IRT is cable driven parallel robots. These robots, by virtue of fixed (grounded motors) have a large easily scalable workspace, while allowing high platform accelerations. Typical applications include logistic operations and large scale machining.

    <p>
    Optimus is an asynchornous hard drive testing system developed by Xyratex. I was a member of the thermal and dynamic engineering team that developed and tested the dynamic isolation system and thermal conditions within each testing slot. The objective was to ensure that hard drive was dynamically isolated from (a) hard drives tested in adjacent slots and (b) disturbance caused by the system's automation and cooling systems. In addition to this, the system had to be thermally controlled to obtain optimal testing conditions.
