 <h3> FAST Project</h3>
<p>
    The project FAST is a IRT project in partnership with Renault and Europe Technologies. I was responsable for the human/robot coexistence work package. The objectives was to allow the installation of robotic systems with fences or physical security devices. In order to do this, we designed a series of security modes or states for the robot.
