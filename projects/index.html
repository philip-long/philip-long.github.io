 <h3> FAST Project</h3>
<p>
    The project FAST is a IRT project in partnership with Renault and Europe Technologies. I was responsable for the human/robot coexistence work package. The objectives was to allow the installation of robotic systems without fences or physical security devices. In order to do this, we designed a series of security modes or states for the robot.

    In this video, an example pick and place operation using a universal robot and a versaball (<a>http://empirerobotics.com/</a>) is shown. Passive behavior is triggered by an ultrasound sensor.

 <h3> ARMS Project</h3>
<p>
     ARMS is an ANR ARPEGE project accepted in 2010 for 4 years. It is funded by the french National Agency of Research. The main goal of the project is to demonstrate the capabilities of a multi-arms system in muscle separation tasks.
     I was responsable for the modeling and control of the multi-arm system. The main contributions of this work were: multi-robot control of deformable bodies, robotic cutting using force/vision controllers

    In this video, a global controller is simulated for the meat cutting task. The object is modeled using finite elements and simulated in MSC ADAMS.

    In this video, an example closed chain manipulation of a deformable object is demonstrated. The object is modeled using finite elements and simulated in MSC ADAMS.

    In this video, the formalism derived for cooperative manipulators is applied  to a parallel Gough Stewart manipulator.  At high accelerations, the platform may deform. As closed form solution for the inverse dynamic model is derived and  validated in MSC ADAMS

    In this video, the robotic separation of a soft foam like material is shown. The deformable trajectory is tracked by a camera, while a force controller is used to ensure global deformation (i.e. ripping of the material) is avoided. The force correction is applied in the Cartesian space. A second robot maintains the object and reduced cutting friction by opening up the cutting valley

    <i> 
        In this video, the robotic separation of a soft foam like material is shown. In this case, the control law is formulated entirely in the image space of the camera, leading to a robust controller. In addition to this, the by using image moments, 6-DOF can be controlled. The force correction is applied directly in the image space.

    <h3> Cable Driven Parallel Robot</h3>
    <p>
        One of the principal research areas of the robotics team at IRT is cable driven parallel robots. These robots, by virtue of fixed (grounded motors) have a large easily scalable workspace, while allowing high platform accelerations. Typical applications include logistic operations and large scale machining.

        In this video, a prototype of a cable driven parallel robot is shown. I was responsible for the modeling and control of the system and supervised the controller implementation in a real-time software architecture.
