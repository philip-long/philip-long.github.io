<p>
    The project FAST is a IRT project in partnership with Renault and Europe Technologies. I was responsable for the human/robot coexistence work package (18 months).
 The objective was to allow the installation of robotic systems without fences or physical security devices. In order to do this, we designed a series of security modes or states for the robot. Due to the success of this work package, I was asked to particiapte in the industrialisation of the system WP5 (6 months).

    In this video, a high speed displacement is shown, an infra-red sensor is used to trigger the passive behaviour. Photoelectric sensors are used to trigger the robot's reduced mode.

    In this video, an example pick and place operation using a universal robot and a versaball (<a>http://empirerobotics.com/</a>) is shown. Passive behavior is triggered by an ultrasound sensor.  Photoelectric sensors are used to trigger the robot's reduced mode.
