        One of the principal research areas of the robotics team at IRT is cable driven parallel robots. These robots, by virtue of fixed (grounded motors) have a large easily scalable workspace, while allowing high platform accelerations. Typical applications include logistic operations and large scale machining.

        In this video, a prototype of a cable driven parallel robot is shown. I was responsible for the modeling and control of the system and supervised the controller implementation in a real-time software architecture.
