    Hello and welcome to my website! I am a robotic research engineer from Ireland currently living in Boston. My research interests include: kinematic and dynamic modeling of serial, parallel and cable driven robots, control of cooperative robots, visual servoing and human robot collaboration. 
    </p>

     <p>
I am currently a  postdoctoral researcher at the  <a href="www.robot.neu.edu"> RIVeR lab</a>, in Northeastern univeristy, working with the Valkyrie humanoid robot. My research focuses principally on dual arm manipulation in constrained environments and whole body control using exteroceptive sensor feedback.            
    </p>

Before this I worked as a  researcher in the robotics team at  <a href="http://www.irt-jules-verne.fr"> IRT Jules Verne </a> (Institut de recherche technologique), Bouguenais, France. My work at IRT focused primarily on collaborative robots (cobots) for industrial partners (Renault, Airbus, STX, GE amongst others). In addition to this, I worked extensively on cable driven parallel robots and vision force control for industrial applications.

    I carried out my PhD research in IRCCyN <a href="https://ls2n.fr/"> (LS2N) </a>, Ecole Centrale de Nantes, France between 2011-2014. My thesis focused mainly on the kinematic and dynamic modeling of closed chain systems in particular cooperative robots. Other contributions included force/vision control for deformable object separation and the modeling of parallel robots with flexible platforms. </p> 
  
    <p>
    Prior to this I participated in the EMARO program, a two year European research masters (Italy and France) in advanced robotics. I obtained my bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from NUI Galway in Ireland. After which I spent two years working as a mechanical engineer, specializing in finite element analysis and vibration isolation, in Xyratex in the UK/Malaysia.
