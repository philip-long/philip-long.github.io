<h3> Fast startup</h3>

<p>      
It was my tri-annual boot day today, it goes something like this
</p>

<li> Boot up in windows 10, to (a) fill in a word/excel document (b) do some solid works modeling</li>
<li> There's inevitably a backlog of updates, when finished click update and restart</li>
<li> Promptly forget about update and continue life on linux parition</li>
<li> Someone sends me an urgent excel sheet or word templated document</li>
<li> Said doc looks wierd in libre office </li>
<li> Boot in windows to deal with this, 15 minutes of updates while my PC <i> restarts several times</i></li>
<li> Deal with document </li>
<li> Boot back into Linux,  data partition is inaccessible beacuse  fast startup has re-enabled itself</li>
<li> Boot back into windows</li>
<li> Got to Power Options </li>
<li> Choose what the power buttons do </li>
<li> Change settings that are currently unavailable</li>
<li> Uncheck the Turn on fast startup box </li>
<li> Wait until I have to (a) fill in a word/excel document (b) do some solid works modeling</li>
<li> Repeat</li>
