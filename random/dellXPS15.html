<h3> 1. Installation</h3>
  
   <li>I installed ubuntu 14.04 alongside windows 10 using a bootable live USB</li>
   <li>Firstly we need to disable fast booting and hibernate in windows 10 (we also need to do this to shrink the volume to create free space for the install)</li>
   <li>Disable secure boot from the BIOS</li>
   <li>Choose to boot from USB using UEFI i.e. not legacy mode, again in the BIOS options</li>
   <li>Once ubuntu has booted it it should recognize the other operating systems present, if it doesn't there is something wrong, probably you're booting in legacy mode</li>
   <li>Afterwards it should be OK to install in the normal fashion.</li>

<h3> 2. Graphics card </h3>
    <li> Using NVIDIA 381.22 did not work for me, bascially no gui was loaded at all</li>
    <li> The previous version of NVIDIA (378 ?) worked well except when I connected via HDMI to an external monitor, then I had very poor graphics and lots of freezing. I think the issue is that NVIDIA controls the external screen whereas INTEL run the built in display. Apparently this is physically wired but there is a config file to edit as a work around. </li>   
    <li> Currently I'm using the X.Org driver that's working great including with the external screen. There are occasional graphics glitches, notably with matlab but nothing I can't live with. </li>

<h3> 3. Ethernet & Wifi </h3>
<li> Wifi card is <b>Qualcomm Atheros QCA6174 802.11ac Wireless Network Adapter</b>, I had absolutely no luck in getting this to work. Eventually I bought a Panda 300Mbps Wireless N USB Adapter.</li>
   <li> Laptop doesn't have a dedicated Ethernet port, I am using USB Network Adapter, <b>Rankie SuperSpeed USB 3.0 to RJ45 Gigabit Ethernet Network Adapter - R1161</b>,   </li>   
   <li> However my etherent connection was unbearably slow even causing the computer to freeze up every so often. For example any sudo command took about 30 seconds to be executed, opening a folder in nautilus also caused an unresponsive screen. The process <b>,wpa_supplicant</b>, was using as much as 90% of the CPU. I tried a lot of things to resolve this inculding fiddling with my interent settings and disabling IPvS 6 but no luck. Eventually I completely purged (sudo apt-get purge network-manager) network manager and installed wicd (do this first) which resolved the issue.</li>
