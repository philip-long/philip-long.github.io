 <h2> Dell xps 15 & Ubuntu 14.04</h2>
    
<p>
    For ubunutu 14.04 to work well on the dell xps 15 I had to do a little bit of messing about. Here's some tips that worked for me.
</p>

<h3> To install alongside windows 10, assuming we've created a bootable live usb </h3>
  
   <li>Disable fast booting and hibernate ( we also need to do this to shrink the volume, create free space for the install</li>
   <li> Disable secure boot</li>
   <li>Choose to boot from USB using UEFI i.e. not legacy mode</li>
   <li>Once ubuntu has booted it it should recognize the other operating systems present, if it doesn't there is something wrong</li>
   <li>Afterwards it should be OK to install in the normal fashion.  </li>
