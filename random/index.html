 <h2> Dell xps 15 & Ubuntu 14.04</h2>
    
<p>
    For ubunutu 14.04 to work well on the dell xps 15 I had to do a little bit of messing about. Here's some tips that worked for me.
</p>
<h3> To install alongside windows 10, assuming we've created a bootable live usb <h3/>
  <li>
   <i> Disbale fast booting and hibernate ( we also need to do this to shrink the volume, create free space for the install
   <i> Disable secure boot
   <i> Choose to boot from USB using UEFI i.e. not legacy mode
   <i> Once ubuntu has booted it it should recognize the other operating systems present, if it doesn't there is something wrong
   <i> Afterwards it should be ok to install in the normal fashion.  
  </li>
