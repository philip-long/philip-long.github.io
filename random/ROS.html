<h3> 1. Qtcreator</h3>
  <p>
  Qtcreator is a great IDE especially for C++ and ROS. 
  </p>
   <li> First don't forget to open Qtcreator from a sourced terminal and select the uppermost CMakeLists.txt as the project (not CamkeLists associated with each package)</li>
   <li>catkin_init_workspace creates a CMakeLists.txt which is actually a symbolic link towards pointing towards the toplevel cmake. For Qtcreator to work this needs to be replaced</li>
   rm CMakeLists.txt ; cp /opt/ros/indigo/share/catkin/cmake/toplevel.cmake ./CMakeLists.txt
